            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Chanto's Farm Bss is an online marketplace for African farmers developed by a Farmer for farmers. We understand the context to build the largest online farmers' marketplace in Africa. We aim to connect farmers with sellers and suppliers with farm
            inputs and people from different countries to get agricultural products they want easily online. Despite whether they have a smartphone, electronic devices or not; they can still access our services
            using USSD. We connect African farmers with sellers across the world. As agriculture is the main sector in Africa; 
            we believe that once it is developed; we will move from a less developed continent to the most developed continent.</p>
